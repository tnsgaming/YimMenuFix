# YimMenuFix

Here are some screenshot https://imgur.com/a/LBwROCY how I use mod menu without any issue. In this screenshots you can see I use Stand menu to inject YimMenu bcs this YimMenu is an older build version by original creator and someone updated it for working in new GTA 5 updated version.

Without using Stand you will get desync attack by other players. So must inject Yimmenu with Stand for a great gameplay experience.

**Step 1** <br>
Download YimMenu form the link : https://github.com/Mr-X-GTA/YimMenu/releases/tag/nightly

**Step 2** <br>
Download Stand from the link : [Stand for GTA V](https://stand.sh/)

**Step 3** <br>
Download FSL from the link : [UnKnoWnCheaTs - Multiplayer Game Hacking and Cheats - version.dll](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=47299) and follow the steps to how run the FSL.

**Step 4** <br>
Open Stand menu and go to advance click ADD button and select YimMenu.dll.

before going Step 5 make sure your battle eye is OFF in Rockstar launcher and go to Epic->Library->GTAV->Manage and type "-nobattleey"

**Step 5** <br>
Click Launch button on Stand and go to story mod then go to invite only session and make a 10M by pressing the "~" key on your keyboard and press enter to get 10M instant money also you have FSL so you are safe and low risk. Go to public session and enjoy.
